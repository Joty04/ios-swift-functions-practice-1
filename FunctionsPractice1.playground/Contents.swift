//Functions Practice #1

//Welcome back! This will be your first interactive practice on Functions! Remember that a function is just a reusable block of code that can be run by calling it by name.

// There are 4 pieces: the function name, the input (and input type_, the output (or return type), and the code to be run when the function gets called. Take a crack at building the functions below. We've done the first one for you...

// #1) Build a function timesByOneThousand that takes an integer and multiplies it by 1000.

func timesByOneThousand(number:Int) -> Int {
    let x:Int = number * 1000
    return x
}

timesByOneThousand(11)
timesByOneThousand(23)

// #2) Build a function howOldIWillBeIn2030 that takes in your age (as an integer) and tells you how old you will be in the year 2030.

// #3) Build a function makeExcited that takes a string, makes it all uppercase and adds three exclamation points.

// #4) Build a function called isEven that returns a boolean (true or false) depending on whether or not the number is divisible by 2.

// #5) Build a function called gradeCalculator that takes in a number (0 to 100) and returns the letter grade that corresponds to it.
