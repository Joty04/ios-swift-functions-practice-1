//make a function called myAge that returns the integer value of your age






//make a function called fullName that returns a string containing your full name

//print("Hi! My name is \(fullName()). I am \(myAge()) and I'm from \(homeTown()).")










//BONUS: Write a function called inchesToCentimeters that takes in a number of inches and returns the equivalent 
//amount of centimeters (You'll have to look up how to use arguments...)
